# What is this?
If you've found that the localization task is quite boring and frustrating, this is the tool for you.
It can,
- Translate (Google's Translation)
- Write it to .resx file.

# How can I use it?
1. Make these 4 .resx files. Empty resource file will do.
  - Resources.resx (English)(base)
  - Resources.zh-CN.resx (Simplified Chinese)
  - Resources.zh-TW.resx (Traditional Chinese)
  - Resources.ja-JP.resx (Japanese)

2. Select the base .resx file from File menu.
